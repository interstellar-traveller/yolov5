This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on January 21, 2022 at 7:28 AM GMT

It includes 120 images.
Balls are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -24 and +24 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
